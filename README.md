# Applied Project Audio – Emotion Prediction Experiments
A brief Introduction:
The experiment involved conducting interviews with various participants, led by professional psychologists. During these interviews, the psychologists actively attempted to elicit specific emotional responses from the participants. After each session, the psychologists assessed and ranked the intensity of several emotions experienced by each participant.

These interviews were also recorded, and the audio data was processed through a deep learning model to extract embeddings — numerical representations capturing features of the recordings. As students, we were given these embeddings (i.e., the model’s output) and tasked with analyzing them. Our goal was to apply machine learning models to interpret and predict the emotional states encoded in the embeddings, effectively bridging the gap between the raw output of the deep learning system and the psychological assessments.


This project investigates supervised machine learning models for predicting emotional responses from audio data, focusing on Lasso Regression and XGBoost. We analyze a dataset of 1920 features and 6423 samples, targeting five emotions: Arousal, Valence, Interest, Despair, and Joy. The work is split into two phases: model evaluation and data augmentation experiments. For a detailed analysis, see the project report Applied Project 52056 v2.pdf . The .ipynb files contain the Python code.
